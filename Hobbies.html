            <h1>Fitness Obsession</h1>
            <p>
                Dating back to when I still was in the final year of high school, I realized that I actually was a little out of shape.
                Although I was not overweight, but I deeply knew that it didn't look cool. Besides, I always have a profound craving for the ab muscles
                since when I was young. So I determined my mind to go on a route that I will never regret. Gaining muscles is not easy, neither is
                keeping low body fat. In this process, I learned about how to control my daily diet, what to eat and what I must not. And those
                equipments in the gym couldn't be more familiar to me. It is a tranformation of body, but it is more of a transformation of mind.
                It illustrates my perseverance, while the muscles sculpted on me is the reward. This is my fitness obsession.

            <h1>I'm a Apple Fan</h1>
            <p>
                Me knowing about the products of Apple is literally by chance. In 2009, when I was in middle school, my friend's father gifted my father a device from Hongkong.
                It came with the name "iPod Touch", which had opened up a new world to me since then. It was quite special, because there wasn't anything like it in the market back then.
                The design was simply gorgeous and flawless. When I operated it, I was so facinated by it's response speed and overall fluency it offered.
                Ever since then, I became a fan of Apple, starting to learn its history and culture. And of course, Steve Job is definately the man I worship.
                All these years, I watched every keynote including World Wide Developers Conferenece and launch of new products. And I experienced the process of Apple improving their services
                and enriching the capabilities of their products. It is a great company, still innovative even without Steve Jobs. And I believe, someday not far from now, a new product will come along,
                again changing everything.

                    Coding is like magic. You type in lines of code, and you get a program doing whatever you want. Automation, workflow, games and many utility applications are all
                    the results you can achieve by coding. Despite that bugs can be irritating, that can be eliminated by programmers' patience and constant learning.
                    As soon as I entered this university, I know that I'm gonna pick Software Engineering as my major, because that's where my interest consists in.
                    When I graduate, I will do coding and developing as my job for a living. And I am so fortunate to see it more than just a job, while I can find joy
                    in this thing.
